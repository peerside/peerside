### Who I am ..
:wave: I'm Paul Power, an experienced software and data technology leader with over 20 years experience shipping successful commercial products. I am based in [Dublin, Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin) but I spend most of my time working and communicating with globally distributed teams.

I'm seeking my next challange and a team focused on leveraging data to do something daring or disruptive. I add most value as a director level individual contributor where I work with diverse teams to proactively identify and unblock issues, recommend solutions and identify oppertunities.
